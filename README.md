# Visions AI: Creative Studio 🌌✨

Visions AI is an immersive, high-performance web application designed for creating, refining, and variation-generating stunning custom artwork using **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**. Built with a sleek minimalist design, modern typography, custom canvas-based physics particles, and smooth GSAP entrance choreography.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy & User Experience

- **Minimalist Slate Theme**: Centered around high contrast, gorgeous negative space, and premium material aesthetics. The studio supports both crisp light and atmospheric dark modes.
- **Rushing Meteors Background**: A fully responsive, lightweight Canvas-based physics animation that adjusts its blending modes and colors seamlessly to match active light or dark aesthetics.
- **GSAP Cinema-Grade Entry**: Choreographed, staggered entry animations for text elements, call-to-actions, and highlights that build a high-end visual greeting card layout.
- **Atmospheric Depth**: Immersive glowing gradients and backdrops active in dark mode to complement liquid reflection, glassmorphic refraction, and glowing cybernetic presets.

## ⚡ Core Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Directly query **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** with custom, descriptive prompts.
- **Intelligent Refinement (Inpainting / Edits)**: Select any generated vision to modify it on-the-fly (e.g., *"add a giant glowing moon"*, *"make it rain"*, *"shift color palette to neon purple"*).
- **Style Presets**: One-click integrations for high-end styles including *Glassmorphism*, *Surrealism*, *Cyberpunk*, *Pencil Sketch*, *Oil Painting*, and advanced futuristic *Gemini Neural Networks*.
- **Subtle Variations**: Effortlessly create sibling variants of an image, preserving the core style and structure while introducing fine detailed differences.
- **Interactive History**: Review previously generated visions with standard key-value local persistence caching across page reloads.
- **Download Ready**: Instantly save your favorite generated canvases in high-fidelity PNG formats.
